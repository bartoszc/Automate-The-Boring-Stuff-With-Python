# LOGGING LEVELS

# DEBUG - The lowest level. Used for small details. Usually you care about these messages only when diagnosing problems.
# INFO - to record information on general events in your program or confirm that things are working at their point in the program.
# WARNING - Used to indicate a potential problem that doesnâ€™t prevent the program from working but might do so in the future.
# ERROR - Used to record an error that caused the program to fail to do something.
# CRITICAL - The highest level. Used to indicate a fatal error that has caused or is about to cause the program to stop running entirely.
